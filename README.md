# Kubeson
Kubeson provides a tabbed interface to visualize JSON logs generated by Kubernetes's pods. It is composed of two panels, the first contains the normal log view list, where you may browse the logs. Uppon selection of a JSON log line, it is displayed in the second panel, where the JSON is formatted for easy visualization.

Currently Kubeson only connects to the Kubernetes connection defined in the user's home directory .kube folder. Kubeson's main usage is for developers to connect to minikube to visualize the logs.

# Installation

Kubeson requires a Java 8 32 Bits (x86) JVM from build 60 to build 181. The latest version of Java 8 has a bug in the JavaFx UI, which will be fixed in the upcomming release. Kubeson checks for a supported JVM, in case it does not find it, it will show an error message.

It is advisable to install Java 8 32 Bits (x86) build 181.

After checking that you have a supported JVM, just unzip the Kubeson package in a folder that the user has write permission and double click in kubeson.exe
